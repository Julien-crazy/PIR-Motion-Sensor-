# PIR-Motion-Sensor-
1. The PIR Motion Sensor used in this assignment functions by detecting motion based on changes in infrared changes. This kind of motion sensor is used today for many security purposes in businesses and home grounds.
2. In this miniture project I used a PIR mottion sensor in which a LED begins to start blinking when motion is detected. The project worked very smoothly and even turns off when motion isn't detected. Though, there is a slight delay when it starts/stops blinking due to the adjusting change in infrared.
   HERE IS A VIDEO EXAMPLE OF THE PIR MOTION SENSOR IN EFFECT
